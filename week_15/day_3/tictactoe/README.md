Tic Tac Toe 

I will be making TicTacToe in React. 

This game will need to follow game logic and need various components such as 
a game, board, player and squares. 

Each tictactoe game has 9 squares that can be populated when a player takes a turn and puts a piece down. 

The winner is decided when the player has three of their pieces in a row. 
A draw is decided when both players failed to get three pieces in a row and is the consequence of failing to find a winner or a defeated player.

A piece > square > that is on a BOARD > that is contained in a game.

A square could be something that could be pressed and when pressed it changes to an X or O. 

So could start by making a board that is a table so it would have 3 columns and 3 rows.
